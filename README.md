# Project_9
This projects talks about aquiring customers using machine learning algorithms. To find the number of prospects you should target (i.e. how many top deciles you should target), you will assume that the cost of a call varies with duration as follows: Cost per call (INR) = 0.033*(duration_in_seconds) + 0.8. Based on this, you will figure out the X in top X%, i.e. how many prospects should be called to meet the business objective. The business objective is to achieve 80% of total responders at the minimum possible cost. The total number of responders is the total number of prospects who responded, from the available data of about 45,000 data points.
